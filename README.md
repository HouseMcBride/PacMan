# PacMan
WEEK 4 PacMan Movement Exercise Assignment at MIT

### Description 
The assignment was to simulate PacMan biting down across the screen. I used four different images of PacMan. I was able to update them giving the illusion he was eating. 

### Installation
It was made in the browser. No additional software is necessary.  

### Usage
The function is called on a mouse click. Every time it is called it will update the image, position and direction on the screen. 

### Support

### Roadmap
Ultimately I would love to apply some arrow key functionality. Let Pac move freely. I could afford to add some animation and colors. Ghosts for him to eat!
